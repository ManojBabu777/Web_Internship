                A <b>car</b> is a motor vehicle with wheels. Most definitions of cars state that they run
                primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people, not
                cargo.
                French inventor <i>Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot</i> built the first steam-powered road vehicle in 1769, while
                French-born Swiss inventor François Isaac de Rivaz designed and constructed the first internal
                combustion-powered automobile in 1808. The modern car—a practical, marketable automobile for everyday
                use—was invented in 1886, when German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Commercial
                cars became widely available during the 20th century. One of the first cars affordable by the masses was
                the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in
                the US, where they replaced horse-drawn carriages. In Europe and other parts of the world, demand for
                automobiles did not increase until after World War II. The car is considered an essential part of the
                developed economy.
